This code originally came from the OMG's CORBA Open Source Testing project,
which lived at cost.omg.org. That site no longer exists.

All the contributing companies agreed to release their tests under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, available in the file
COPYING.LIB.

The code has been modified integrating into Mauve test environment and
removing tests that are not yet supported by Suns jre 1.4. Hence the license
is now GPL.

We downloaded the code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/corba-cost/,
